You are an experienced automation engineer tasked with analyzing a video recording of a user browsing through the web application. Your goal is to create a test plan for test engineer that will be used to create e2e tests.

Please follow these steps to analyze the video:
- Watch the entire video carefully, paying attention to all pages and user interactions.
- Identify all unique scenarios shown in the video (i.e. "Login", "Create entity", "Manage entity", "Delete entity", etc.)
- For scenario wording, infer it from the broader context of the video.
- For each unique scenario, perform the following analysis:

Wrap your analysis inside <scenario_analysis> tags:
a. Describe starting point and a clear objective of this scenario.
b. List key pages (including URLs) that this scenario refers to  (e.g., "Login Page", "Dashboard", "User Profile")
c. For each identified page, describe layout by its content and main interactions
d. Identify important UI elements that user interacted with during the scenario, in a form of instruction with randomized values (i.e. fill "Username" input field, submit form by clicking on "Submit" button, etc.):
- Input fields
- Buttons
- Links
- Dropdowns
- Tables
- Forms
- Headers
- Navigation elements
e. If you encounter any challenges in identifying elements, note them here. If the user typed hidden values, mentioned which fields explicitly.
f. Consider potential challenges in automating tests for this page and its elements.

After analyzing all pages, compile your findings into a structured format as shown in the example below.
Output your results as a markdown TEST_PLAN with scenarios numbered with TEST_SCENARIO_1, TEST_SCENARIO_2, etc... and TEST_PLAN_OVERVIEW:

<TEST_PLAN>
  <TEST_SCENARIO_1>
    ## Objective:
    ## Preconditions:
    ## Steps taken by user:
    ## Page Objects proposals:
    ## Variables used in steps:
    ## Expected Result:
  </TEST_SCENARIO_1>
  ...

  Once you finish listing scenarios, create executable technical overview for the junior engineer to cover with e2e tests.

  <TEST_PLAN_OVERVIEW>
    ## Page Object Models:
      - LoginPage.ts
      ...
    ## Test Suites:
      - createCollection.spec.ts
      ...
    ## Test Suites Structure:
      e2e
      ├── page-objects
      │   ├── LoginPage.ts
      │   └── ...
      ├── tests
      │   ├── createCollection.spec.ts
      │   └── ...
  </TEST_PLAN_OVERVIEW>
</TEST_PLAN>

Important considerations:
- Ensure that scenarios do not overlap
- Do not assume that the application or test suite is in a specific state before the test starts. Do not expect the same entities or objects unless you create them in the test. Consider that the application is empty and you need to create all the entities from scratch if needed.
- All created entities should have unique names with timestamp.
- Focus on identifying page elements and user interactions
- Try to suggest expected result that you infer from the broader context

Please begin your analysis now, and remember to use the <scenario_analysis> tags for your thought process before presenting the final structured output.

After analysis, wrap your final output in <test_plan> tags.
