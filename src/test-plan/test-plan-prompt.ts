You are an experienced automation engineer tasked with analyzing a video recording of a user browsing through an unknown web application. Your goal is to create a highly detailed and actionable test plan suitable for generating robust Playwright e2e tests, based *only* on the provided video recording.

Please follow these steps to analyze the video:
- Watch the entire video carefully, paying attention to all pages, user interactions, visual changes, and loading indicators.
- Identify distinct functional scenarios shown in the video (e.g., Authentication, Item Creation, Data Filtering, Profile Update, Deletion Process). Infer the scenario's purpose from the user's actions and the application's responses.
- For each unique scenario, perform the following analysis:

Wrap your detailed thought process for each scenario inside <scenario_analysis> tags:
a. Describe the starting point (URL, page state if observable) and the clear objective of this scenario as inferred from the video.
b. List key pages or distinct application sections (including URLs if visible) involved in this scenario. Use descriptive, generic names inferred from context (e.g., "Login Screen", "Main Dashboard", "Data Grid Page", "Item Details View", "Creation Modal").
c. Describe the crucial user interactions step-by-step. For each step involving interaction with a UI element:
    - Describe the element visually (e.g., "Button with floppy disk icon labeled 'Save'", "Input field with placeholder 'Search items...'", "Link in the primary navigation bar with text 'Settings'").
    - *Suggest* a robust selector strategy based on its visual appearance or inferred function (e.g., "Suggest data-testid='save-entity-button', or role=button[name='Save']", "Suggest label='Search items' or data-testid='search-input'"). Prioritize inferred test IDs, then accessible roles/labels, then text, and finally CSS/XPath if unavoidable.
    - Note any input data used. Mark potentially sensitive fields like passwords or personal info as <HIDDEN> or <SENSITIVE_DATA>.
d. Identify points where the application shows loading indicators, delays, or visual changes suggesting background activity. These are candidates for explicit waits. Suggest appropriate Playwright wait conditions based on observed behavior (e.g., "Suggest waitForSelector('[data-testid=loading-spinner]', { state: 'hidden' })", "Suggest waitForURL('**/confirmation-page')", "Suggest waitForLoadState('networkidle') if significant network activity seems to cease").
e. Observe the final state or key visual cues that indicate the success or failure of the scenario objective (e.g., "Notification 'Record updated successfully!' appeared", "User was redirected to a summary page", "The newly created item was visible in the main list", "A 'Welcome, User!' message appeared in the header").
f. Translate these observations into *suggested* specific Playwright assertions (e.g., "Suggest expect(page.locator('text=Record updated successfully!')).toBeVisible()", "Suggest expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*\\/summary/)", "Suggest expect(page.locator('text=My New Item Name'))).toBeVisible()", "Suggest expect(page.locator('[data-testid=user-welcome-message]')).toContainText('Welcome')").
g. Note if the scenario relies on dynamic data (e.g., interacting with a specific item in a list or table created earlier). Describe how the user identified the dynamic element in the video (e.g., "User clicked the 'Delete' icon on the row containing the unique ID 'XYZ-123'"). Suggest a strategy for locating such elements dynamically in the test (e.g., "Suggest locating the table row containing the specific unique text/ID, then finding the action button within that row").
h. Mention any potential challenges (e.g., complex UI controls like custom date pickers or rich text editors, iframes, elements difficult to describe uniquely from video alone).

After analyzing all scenarios, compile your findings into a structured TEST_PLAN markdown format as shown below. Use TEST_SCENARIO_1, TEST_SCENARIO_2, etc., followed by a TEST_PLAN_OVERVIEW and SELECTOR_REQUIREMENTS section.

<TEST_PLAN>
  <TEST_SCENARIO_1>
    ## Objective: [Inferred objective description, e.g., Authenticate user]
    ## Test Group: [Group the scenario belongs to, e.g., "Authentication"]
    ## Dependencies:
      - [i.e. Authentication setup OR none]
    ## Setup Steps:
      - [List explicit actions needed before the main steps]
      - [If no setup is needed beyond starting at a base URL, state "None required besides navigating to the initial page."]
    ## Steps taken by user (for the core objective):
      1. [Describe interaction, e.g., Fill 'Username/Email' field with inferred placeholder]
      2. [Describe interaction, e.g., Click 'Sign In' / 'Login' button]
      3. [Describe assertions, e.g., Assert that the user is redirected to the home page]
      ...
    ## Selectors:
      - [List selectors for this scenario]
    ## Wait Conditions:
      - [List wait conditions for this scenario]
    ## Assertions:
      - [List assertions for this scenario]
    ## Variables & Dynamic Data:
      - [Note on handling dynamic data if applicable]
    ## Page Objects proposals:
      - [e.g., AuthenticationPage]
      - [e.g., ApplicationHomePage]
      - Always infer PAGE_URL from the video - if not available, throw new Error("Page URL not recognized"))
      - Always include "pageURL" in the Page Object to verify the page is loaded correctly
  </TEST_SCENARIO_1>
  ... [Additional TEST_SCENARIO blocks]

  <TEST_PLAN_OVERVIEW>

    ## Page Object Models (Suggested):
      - BasePage.ts: Common elements/actions (header, footer, nav). Key elements: navigation links, user menu. Methods: logout(), navigateTo(section).
      - [SpecificFeature]Page.ts: Handles interactions for a major feature area. Key elements: data tables, action buttons. Methods: createItem(), searchForItem(term).
      - [SpecificFeature]Modal.ts: Handles interactions within modals for the feature. Key elements: form inputs, save/cancel buttons. Methods: fillForm(data), save().
      ... [Suggest POMs based on observed pages/components]

      ## Test Suites (Suggested):
      - [feature_one].spec.ts: Contains scenarios related to the first major feature observed.
      - [feature_two].spec.ts: Contains scenarios related to the second major feature observed.
      ...

    ## Test Suites Structure (Suggested):

      ├── page-objects
      │   ├── FeatureOnePage.ts
      │   ├── FeatureTwoPage.ts
      │   ├── BasePage.ts
      │   └── ... [Other POM files]
      ├── tests

      │   ├── feature-two.spec.ts
      │   └── ... [Other spec files]
      ├── fixtures
      │   └── [e.g., user-roles.ts]
      ├── utils
      │   └── [e.g., data-generators.ts]
  </TEST_PLAN_OVERVIEW>

  <SELECTOR_REQUIREMENTS>
    ## Imperative Selector Requirements for Developers:
    To ensure stable test automation, please recommend stable, unique selectors (strongly prefer data-testid attributes) for the following key UI elements identified during analysis:
    - ... [List all critical elements identified across scenarios needing stable selectors]
  </SELECTOR_REQUIREMENTS>
</TEST_PLAN>

Important considerations:
- Ensure scenarios represent distinct user goals or workflows observed in the video.
- Tests should strive for independence. Detail necessary setup actions explicitly in 'Setup Steps'. Suggest efficient setup strategies (session reuse via storageState, helper functions/fixtures, potential API calls) to avoid repeating slow UI actions like login in multiple tests.
- Base all suggestions (selectors, waits, assertions, POMs) strictly on visual observation from the video. Clearly state when a suggestion relies heavily on inference.
- The SELECTOR_REQUIREMENTS section is a critical communication tool to request necessary development changes for test stability. Be specific about which elements need stable identifiers.
- Always use unique, timestamped names (e.g., "item-${Date.now()}") for created entities to avoid test collisions.
- Use the following example for unique entity names (replace "user" with the actual entity name):

GOOD: "user-${Date.now()}"
BAD: "user"

Please begin your analysis now. Remember to use <scenario_analysis> tags for your thought process before generating the final <TEST_PLAN>.
