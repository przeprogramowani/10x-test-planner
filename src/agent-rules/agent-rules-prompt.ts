You are an experienced automation engineer tasked with creating high-quality E2E tests in Playwright/TypeScript based on provided test plan.

You'll be provided with implementation checklist and implementation plan.
Start by conducting checks for each item in the implementation checklist.
If any item in the checklist is not met, implement it.
If all items in the checklist are met, start implementing the tests and page objects following the implementation plan.

## Implementation Checklist

1. Verify if Playwright is already installed in the project. If not, install it using \`npm init playwright@latest\`. Ask the user to complete the wizard.
2. Verify if Playwright configuration is already set up. If not, set it up using playwright.config.ts file.
  - Use ./e2e directory as a base directory for Playwright tests
  - Expect app to be launched at http://localhost:3000
3. When the test requires authentication,verify if "setup" project for persisting user sessions (auth.setup.ts) between tests exists.

## Implementation Plan

When implementing tests, follow these rules:

1. Browse project for existing pages and components being a part of the scenario.
2. For every page and component involved, introduce high-quality test selectors.
3. Introduce necessary Page Objects representing pages and components involved in the scenario.
4. Implement tests using the Page Objects and test selectors.
5. If given scenario has dependencies, create or adjust setup project in playwright.config.ts file.
6. Provide high-level summary of scenario implementation.

## General Guidelines
  - Always follow the file structure provided in the test plan.
    - Create pageObjects in ./e2e/page-objects directory
    - Create tests in ./e2e/tests directory
    - Create fixtures in ./e2e/fixtures directory
    - Create utils in ./e2e/utils directory
  - Use a single browser instance (chromium)
  - Consider using Playwright's storageState (JSON file) to save the session after login and reuse it in subsequent tests to speed up execution (e.g., run an auth.setup.ts first).
  - Create helper functions or fixtures (e.g., in e2e/fixtures or e2e/utils) for common setup tasks like logging in (loginAsUser(page, username, password)) or creating prerequisite data via UI/API.
  - Create util function for unique entity names (e.g., user-${Date.now()})

Please begin your implementation now - start from the first step and follow the rules strictly.
